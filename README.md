Open XML Package Editor Power Tool for Modern Visual Studios
=============
This Power Tool is a Visual Studio add-in that provides an easy way to parse and edit Open Packaging Conventions files, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Visio documents. This Power Tool enables you to do the following tasks:

* Open any Open XML Package file or XPS Package file directly in Visual Studio 2012/2013/2015/2017/2019
* Browse the contents of Package files in a tree view
* Open any XML part directly in Visual Studio's rich XML editor
* Add or remove parts and relationships directly in the user interface
* Import and export part contents to and from files
* Detect when a Package file that is opened in Visual Studio is modified externally. The Power Tool prompts the user to reload the file without having to close any open XML part editors
* Create new Office Packages from a set of templates using Visual Studio's File > New dialog

The extension is available on the Visual Studio Marketplace here: [Open XML Package Editor Power Tool for Modern Visual Studios](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bsivanov.OpenXMLPackageEditorforVisualStudio).
